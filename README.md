# HL2RESGen #
HL2RESGen is a tool to create res (resource) files for Half-Life 2, or any other Source game/mod. If the map has a corresponding res file, the game will be able to send all resources the resources the map uses to the clients, if they don't have them. This helps a great deal when running a server with custom maps, instead of the defaults. Most players do not have these custom maps and the resources that should go with them.

The problem with res files, however, is that it can take hours to create one if the resources used by a map are not known. HL2RESGen can shorten this time to mere seconds!
